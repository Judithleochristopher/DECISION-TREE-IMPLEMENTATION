**DESCRIPTION: The task is to build a Decision tree Classifier using Scikit-learn to predict the output. I used the built-in dataset: breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn. This has 2 target classes 0:Malignant; 1:Benign. The steps performed: the dataset is first loaded using load_breast_cancer() and then converted it into the Dataframe for better accessability. Data visualization,Model Building along with evaluation and visualization is done. A higer accuracy score on the test set is achieved, and the confusion matrix and classification report showed a string performance. Here the decision tree model performed well in classifying tumors with high accuracy.
